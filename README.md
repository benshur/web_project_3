**A description of the project and its functionality**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It is my first adaptive and responsive web site project and I'm very proud of it.
  
**A description of the technologies and techniques used**  

In this project I've implemented adaptive and responsive techniques such as css grid and relative values for element sizing.
I've learned to work with Figma and get all brief information from the Figma design file.
